# Generate README for code

This script allows you to generate a README file for any Python code file with the help of OpenAI. It will open a file dialog to allow you to select the Python file that you want to generate the README for, and then it will use OpenAI to generate a README file for the code. The README file will be saved as a Markdown file called README.md.

## Requirements

- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/api-keys/)

## Usage

To use this script, first make sure you have all the requirements installed. You will then need to set your OpenAI API key in the `openai.api_key` variable. After that, you can simply run the script and it will open a file dialog where you can select the Python file that you want to generate a README for. The README file will be saved as a Markdown file called README.md.
